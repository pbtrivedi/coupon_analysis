 2. Drivers with age 25 years or higher and also visit bars at least once a month are twice likely to accept bar coupons compare to the drivers who don't meet this criteria.
 3. Drivers with Kids as passenger tend to ignore bar coupons and only accept at about 20% rate.
 4. Widowed drivers don't prefer bar coupons! Drivers who at least once go to bar per month, not having kids as their passengers and are not widowed accepted bar coupon at 70% rate.
 5. Younger drivers, age less than 30, and go to bar at least once a month prefer bar coupons with 70%+ acceptance rate.
 6. Drivers who make less than 50K and prefer cheaper restaurant accept coupons at an average rate.
